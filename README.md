Task 3: Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Task Description

The goal of Task 3 is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch. CNNs are a fundamental deep learning architecture used for computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object detection.
Implementation Details
The task begins with selecting an image dataset and performing image preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and dataset splitting. A CNN architecture is then designed using multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract hierarchical features from images.
The model is trained on the training dataset and validated using a test dataset. Training progress is monitored using loss and accuracy metrics across epochs.
Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using test accuracy and loss values. Visualization of training and validation curves helps in identifying overfitting or underfitting.
Deliverable
A functional CNN model with:
•	Training and testing performance
•	Accuracy and loss analysis
•	Visual performance plots
