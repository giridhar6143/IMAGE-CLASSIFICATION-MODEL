Task 2: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP


Task Description


Task 2 focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to classify customer reviews as positive or negative using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.
Customer reviews are unstructured text data, which cannot be directly used by machine learning models. Therefore, the task emphasizes converting raw text into meaningful numerical features.
Implementation Details
The task starts with loading a dataset of customer reviews and performing text preprocessing. This includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, eliminating stopwords, and cleaning irrelevant characters. After cleaning, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) technique is applied to transform textual data into numerical vectors that capture the importance of words in each review.
A Logistic Regression classifier is then trained on the transformed data. Logistic Regression is chosen due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong performance in text classification tasks.
Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts sentiments and handles misclassifications.
Deliverable
A Jupyter Notebook showcasing:
•	Text preprocessing pipeline
•	TF-IDF feature extraction
•	Logistic Regression model training
•	Sentiment prediction and evaluation
